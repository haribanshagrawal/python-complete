Design pattern are typically into three categories
this is called Gamma Categorization after erich gamma, one of G0F authors

Creational Patterns
-> Deal with Creation (construction) of objects
-> Explicity (constructor) Vs Implicit (DI, Reflection)
-> Wholsale (single statmnt) vs Picecewise (step by step)

Structural Patterns
    Concerned with the structure (e.g. class members)
    Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying  class interfacr
    Strees the important of good API design

Behavioural Patterns
    They are all different, no central theme

Builder
-----------------
Some Objects are simple and can be created in a single inititalizer called
other objects require a lot of ceremony to create 
Having an object with 10 initialzer arguments is not produdctive
instead, opt for piecewise construction

>> Formal Defintion of builder deisgn pattern
Whene Piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it succinctly (in a breif a clearly expressed manner)
